# Security — Not an Afterthought

> Back to [README](../README.md)

NETrock is built **security-first**. Every decision defaults to the most restrictive option, then selectively opens what's needed.

## Authentication & Session Security

- **JWT in HttpOnly cookies** — tokens never touch JavaScript, immune to XSS theft
- **Refresh token rotation** — single-use tokens with automatic family revocation on reuse detection (stolen token → all sessions invalidated)
- **Security stamp validation** — permission changes propagate to active sessions via SHA-256 hashed stamps in JWT claims, cached in Redis for performance
- **Soft refresh** — role/permission changes invalidate access tokens but preserve refresh tokens, so users silently re-authenticate instead of getting force-logged-out
- **Remember me** — persistent refresh tokens with configurable expiry, non-persistent sessions cleared on browser close

## Authorization & Access Control

- **Permission-based authorization** — atomic permissions (`users.view`, `users.manage`, `roles.manage`, …) enforced on every endpoint via `[RequirePermission]`
- **Role hierarchy protection** — SuperAdmin > Admin > User, with privilege escalation prevention (can't assign roles at or above your own rank)
- **Self-protection rules** — can't lock your own account, can't delete yourself, can't remove your own roles
- **System role guards** — SuperAdmin/Admin/User cannot be deleted or renamed, SuperAdmin permissions are implicit (never stored in DB)
- **Frontend mirrors backend** — route guards, nav filtering, and conditional rendering use the same permission claims, but the backend is always authoritative

## Transport & Headers

- **CORS production safeguard** — startup guard rejects `AllowAllOrigins` in non-development environments
- **CSP with nonce mode** — script-src locked down, Turnstile CAPTCHA whitelisted explicitly
- **Security headers on every response** — `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`, `X-Frame-Options: DENY`, `Referrer-Policy`, `Permissions-Policy`, HSTS in production
- **CSRF protection** — Origin header validation in the SvelteKit API proxy for all state-changing requests

## Rate Limiting & Input Validation

- **Rate limiting** — global + per-endpoint policies (registration has stricter limits), configurable per environment, with IP and user partitioning
- **Input validation everywhere** — FluentValidation on backend (even if frontend already validates), Data Annotations flowing into OpenAPI spec

## Data Protection

- **Soft delete** — nothing is ever truly gone, every mutation tracked with who/when audit fields
- **Audit trail** — automatic `CreatedAt/By`, `UpdatedAt/By`, `DeletedAt/By` on every entity via EF Core interceptor
- **Dev config stripping** — `appsettings.Development.json` and `appsettings.Testing.json` excluded from production Docker images
