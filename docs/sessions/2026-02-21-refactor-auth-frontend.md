# Refactor Frontend Auth with Middleware and Tests

**Date**: 2026-02-21 – 2026-02-22
**Scope**: Frontend authentication refactoring — middleware-based token refresh, error handling, session expiry UX, and comprehensive unit test suite

## Summary

Replaced the hand-rolled `fetchWithAuth` wrapper in the API client with openapi-fetch's built-in middleware API (`onResponse` hook). This cleanly separates auth concerns from API calls, adds proper session expiry handling with toast notifications and login redirect, and distinguishes backend outages from authentication failures.

Added 20 unit tests covering all middleware code paths, then hardened the implementation based on a security review (exact pathname matching, `onAuthFailure` exception safety, explicit credentials, trailing-slash normalization, compile-time OpenAPI spec linkage).

## Changes Made

| File | Change | Reason |
|------|--------|--------|
| `src/frontend/src/lib/api/client.ts` | Auth-agnostic client factory — `createApiClient()` accepts `middleware[]`, `browserClient` created bare | Clean separation: API plumbing knows nothing about auth |
| `src/frontend/src/lib/api/index.ts` | Exports `createApiClient`, `browserClient` (no auth exports) | API barrel stays auth-agnostic |
| `src/frontend/src/lib/auth/middleware.ts` | `createAuthMiddleware()` — 401 refresh, retry, failure callback | All auth logic consolidated under `lib/auth/` |
| `src/frontend/src/lib/auth/middleware.test.ts` | New — 20 vitest tests | Cover all code paths: pass-through, method routing, URL construction, refresh failure, callback resilience, deduplication, guard safety |
| `src/frontend/src/lib/auth/auth.ts` | `getUser()` now returns `GetUserResult` with `{ user, error }` instead of `User \| null`. Added `GetUserResult` interface. Wires `createAuthMiddleware` so server-side loads transparently refresh expired access tokens. | Distinguish "not authenticated" from "backend unavailable"; prevent silent redirect to login when only the access token is expired |
| `src/frontend/src/lib/auth/auth.test.ts` | New — 7 vitest tests for `getUser()` | Cover basic response handling (200, 401, 403, 5xx, network error) and server-side refresh integration (refresh succeeds → retry, refresh fails → not-authenticated) |
| `src/frontend/src/lib/auth/index.ts` | Added `GetUserResult` type re-export | Barrel export consistency |
| `src/frontend/src/routes/+layout.server.ts` | Destructures `{ user, error }` from `getUser()`, passes `backendError` to children | Propagate backend error state to child layouts |
| `src/frontend/src/routes/(app)/+layout.server.ts` | Added `backendError` check → throws 503 before redirect check | Prevent misleading redirect to login when backend is down |
| `src/frontend/src/routes/+layout.svelte` | Wires `createAuthMiddleware` into `browserClient.use()` in `onMount` with toast + redirect | Auth middleware injected at runtime — no module-level mutable state |
| `src/frontend/src/routes/api/[...path]/+server.ts` | Renamed `COOKIE_AUTH_ENDPOINTS` → `COOKIE_AUTH_PATHS` with expanded docs | Clarity — the list controls `?useCookies=true` injection, not generic auth |
| `src/frontend/src/messages/en.json` | Added `auth_sessionExpired_title` and `auth_sessionExpired_description` | i18n for session expiry toast |
| `src/frontend/src/messages/cs.json` | Added Czech translations for session expiry keys | i18n parity |
| `src/frontend/AGENTS.md` | Updated API Client architecture and Authentication Flow sections | Reflect middleware-based architecture and `backendError` propagation |

## Decisions & Reasoning

### Use openapi-fetch middleware instead of custom fetch wrapper

- **Choice**: Adopted `client.use(middleware)` with `onResponse` hook
- **Alternatives considered**: (a) Switch to `@hey-api/openapi-ts` for a batteries-included SDK with built-in interceptors, (b) Keep the `fetchWithAuth` wrapper but improve it
- **Reasoning**: The project already uses openapi-fetch + openapi-typescript for type generation. The middleware API is a first-class feature of the library since v0.9+. Switching libraries would require migrating 24+ files that import `browserClient`. The middleware approach gave us the exact hooks needed with zero migration cost.

### Only retry idempotent methods after token refresh

- **Choice**: After a successful refresh, only auto-retry GET/HEAD/OPTIONS. Non-idempotent methods (POST/PUT/PATCH/DELETE) return the original 401.
- **Alternatives considered**: Retry all methods, or buffer request bodies for safe replay
- **Reasoning**: Automatically retrying a POST after refresh could cause double-submission (e.g., creating two orders). The caller already has the context to retry manually. This matches industry best practices for auth interceptors.

### Auth middleware wired via `browserClient.use()` in layout

- **Choice**: `browserClient` is created bare at module scope; the root layout calls `browserClient.use(createAuthMiddleware(...))` in `onMount`
- **Alternatives considered**: (a) Module-level `setAuthFailureHandler()` callback pattern, (b) Lazy-initialize `browserClient` via `initBrowserClient()` called from the root layout
- **Reasoning**: 24 files import `browserClient` at the top level. Making it lazy would require null checks or `!` assertions everywhere. Using openapi-fetch's `.use()` lets us keep `browserClient` always defined while injecting auth behaviour at runtime. The failure callback is passed directly as a closure — no module-level mutable state needed.

### Structured `GetUserResult` over nullable `User`

- **Choice**: Return `{ user, error }` from `getUser()` instead of `User | null`
- **Alternatives considered**: Throw errors for backend failures, use separate error codes
- **Reasoning**: `User | null` conflates two very different states: "not logged in" and "backend is down". The structured result lets `(app)/+layout.server.ts` show a 503 error page instead of incorrectly redirecting to login during outages.

### Refresh pathname tied to generated OpenAPI spec

- **Choice**: `'/api/auth/refresh' satisfies keyof paths` instead of a plain string constant
- **Alternatives considered**: Plain `const REFRESH_PATHNAME = '/api/auth/refresh'`
- **Reasoning**: If the backend renames the endpoint, `pnpm run api:generate` regenerates `v1.d.ts` and the `satisfies` check surfaces the mismatch at compile time. Zero runtime cost.

### Parameterized method routing tests with `it.each`

- **Choice**: Two `it.each` blocks (idempotent + non-idempotent) instead of 7 individual tests
- **Alternatives considered**: Keep individual tests per method
- **Reasoning**: Identical test structure differing only by method string. `it.each` eliminates copy-paste, makes adding/removing methods a one-line change, and actually increased assertion coverage (HEAD/OPTIONS now get the same assertions as GET).

    P-->>M: 401 Response

    Note over M: onResponse intercepts 401

    P-->>M: 200 OK

    Note over M: Refresh succeeded, method is GET (idempotent)

    M->>P: Retry GET /api/users/me
    P->>API: Forward + new cookies
    API-->>P: 200 + user data
    P-->>M: 200 Response

## Security Review

A strict security review was performed, resulting in hardening fixes:

| Finding | Severity | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| Substring URL match on refresh endpoint | HIGH | Exact `pathname === REFRESH_PATHNAME` comparison |
| `onAuthFailure` fire-and-forget | HIGH | `await` with `try/catch` — sync throws and async rejections handled |
| Dedup test relied on microtask scheduling | HIGH | Rewritten with manually controlled promise |
| No explicit `credentials` on refresh POST | MEDIUM | Added `credentials: 'same-origin'` |
| `baseUrl` trailing-slash double-slash | MEDIUM | Normalized with `replace(/\/$/, '')` at construction |
| `failureHandled` guard undocumented | MEDIUM | Safety invariant documented inline |
| CSRF on refresh POST | MEDIUM | Documented mitigation via proxy origin check |

## Follow-Up Items

- [ ] Consider adding a 503 error page (`+error.svelte`) with a "retry" button for backend outage UX
- [ ] Consider adding a loading skeleton or spinner while the refresh attempt is in-flight
- [ ] Monitor whether concurrent 401 deduplication handles edge cases in production (e.g., tab switching, background tabs)
- [ ] Add component tests for Svelte auth components (`LoginDialog`, `RegisterDialog`) using `@testing-library/svelte`
- [x] Add tests for `getUser()` in `auth.ts` (structured `GetUserResult` return paths)
- [x] Wire `createAuthMiddleware` into `getUser()` for server-side token refresh
- [ ] Add frontend test coverage reporting to CI
