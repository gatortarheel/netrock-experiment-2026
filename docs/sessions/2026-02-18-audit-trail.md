# Full-Stack Audit Trail

**Date**: 2026-02-18
**Scope**: Append-only audit logging for authentication, user management, admin, and role operations with admin and user-facing UI

## Summary

Added a comprehensive audit trail system spanning the entire stack. Every significant user and admin action is now recorded in a dedicated `audit.AuditEvents` table with optional JSONB metadata. Admins can view per-user audit trails from the user detail page, and regular users can see their own activity log in settings.

## Changes Made

| `frontend/src/lib/components/admin/AuditTrailCard.svelte` | New component: paginated audit table for admin user detail | Admin can review user activity |
| `frontend/src/lib/components/settings/ActivityLog.svelte` | New component: paginated audit table for user settings | Users can review own activity |
| `frontend/src/messages/en.json`, `cs.json` | 25+ i18n keys for audit actions and UI labels | Localized action names and column headers |
| `frontend/src/routes/(app)/admin/users/[id]/+page.svelte` | Render `<AuditTrailCard>` | Integrate into admin user detail |
| `frontend/src/routes/(app)/settings/+page.svelte` | Render `<ActivityLog>` | Integrate into user settings |

## Decisions & Reasoning

### Append-only entity (not extending BaseEntity)

- **Choice**: `AuditEvent` is a standalone entity with its own `Id` and `CreatedAt`, not extending `BaseEntity`
- **Alternatives considered**: Extending `BaseEntity` with soft-delete and audit fields
- **Reasoning**: Audit logs must never be soft-deleted or updated. An append-only model is simpler, safer, and avoids circular audit-of-audit scenarios. No `UpdatedAt`/`DeletedAt` fields needed.

### Fire-and-forget logging (never throws)

- **Choice**: `AuditService.LogAsync` catches all exceptions and logs them via `ILogger`
- **Alternatives considered**: Letting exceptions propagate, or using a background queue
- **Reasoning**: Audit instrumentation must never break the primary operation. If DB write fails, the user action still succeeds. A background queue adds complexity without clear benefit at this scale.

### Separate endpoints for admin vs. self

- **Choice**: `GET /api/v1/admin/users/{id}/audit` (permission-gated) and `GET /api/users/me/audit` (authenticated)
- **Alternatives considered**: Single endpoint with conditional logic
- **Reasoning**: Follows existing pattern (admin vs. user controllers). Clear authorization boundaries — admin endpoint requires `Users.View` permission, self endpoint requires only authentication.

### JSONB metadata field

- **Choice**: Optional `string? Metadata` column stored as JSONB in PostgreSQL
- **Alternatives considered**: Structured columns for every possible metadata field, or a separate key-value table
- **Reasoning**: Different actions need different context (role name, target user, IP address). JSONB is flexible and queryable in PostgreSQL without schema changes per action type.

## Post-Review Fixes

Code-review identified and resolved the following issues:

| Issue | Severity | Fix |
|-------|----------|-----|
| JSON injection in audit metadata — string interpolation allowed unescaped user input in JSON fields | HIGH | Replaced `$"{{\"role\":\"{input.Role}\"}}"` with `JsonSerializer.Serialize(new { role = input.Role })` in `AdminService`, `RoleManagementService`, `AuthenticationService` |
| `DeleteBehavior.SetNull` on `AuditEvent.UserId` FK — hard-deleting a user would null out all their audit records, destroying the trail | HIGH | Removed FK + nav property entirely; `UserId` is now a plain historical identifier with an index |
| Missing `CancellationToken` on `ProfileUpdate` audit call in `UserService` | LOW | Passed `ct: cancellationToken` |
| `$effect` in `AuditTrailCard.svelte` didn't read `userId` prop, so wouldn't re-fetch on prop change | LOW | Added explicit `const _uid = userId;` read |
| Audit `.Received()` assertions missing in all existing service tests | TEST | Extracted `_auditService` mock to field in 4 test classes; added `.Received(1)` assertions to all success paths |
| No component tests for `AuditService` itself | TEST | New `AuditServiceTests.cs` with 11 tests (LogAsync + GetUserAuditEventsAsync) |
| No API integration tests for audit endpoints | TEST | 8 new tests across `AdminControllerTests` and `UsersControllerTests` |

## Follow-Up Items

- [ ] Regenerate `v1.d.ts` from live backend (manual types added as placeholder)
- [ ] Add audit event cleanup job (Hangfire) to prune old records
- [ ] Consider adding IP address / user agent to metadata for security-sensitive actions
